# RegistrationWeb
In this post we will create a simple user registration example using Jsp, Servlet, Jdbc in eclipse and tomcat. We will create a user registration form using jsp. On submitting the form, control goes to a servlet. The servlet calls the dao class function, that further communicates with the mysql database using jdbc. And the user registration data is inserted into the database.
